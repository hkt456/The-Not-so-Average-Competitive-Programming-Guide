# Deque
> Two-way line
## Description
- Deque is a line where the waiters can leave the line from the front end and the back end. It is a combination of the Stack and the Queue data structure.
## Definition
- In C++, a deque (double-ended queue) is a data structure that represents a sequence of elements, similar to a vector or list. The term "double-ended" refers to the ability to insert and remove elements from both ends of the deque.

- A deque supports efficient insertion and deletion operations at both the front and the back of the container. It allows constant time complexity O(1) for these operations, unlike a vector which provides efficient insertion and deletion only at the end.


## How to use
- Some of the functions that you can use with the Deque data structure are:
```c++
.push_back(value); // Insert an element at the end of the deque
.push_front(value); // Insert an element at the beginning of the deque

.pop_back(); // Remove the last element from the deque
.pop_front(); // Remove the first element from the deque

.front(); // Access the first element of the deque
.back(); // Access the last element of the deque

.empty(); // Check if the deque is empty
.size(); // Get the number of elements in the deque

```

## Some Problems
- In this same folder, I have added anothger folder dedicated to solving some examplary deque-related problems with my own editorials. You can go check it out.
