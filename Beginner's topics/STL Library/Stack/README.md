> There's more to the language
## Descrition
- Stack is possibly the data structure with the easiest concept to grasp, but a find introductory the other Data Structure problem. In this chapter, we will discover what Stack is, its application in Competitive Programming and some Stack-related problems.
## Definition
- Stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. LIFO means that the last item pushed into the stack is the first item popped out.

- Imagine Stack is like you "stack" up a bunch of golden coins. Everyday, you want to get a certain amount of coins for breakfast. You cannot possibly just grab out the coin from the bottom of the stack, you need to get the coins on the top of the stack first. Similarly, if you want to add more to the stack of coins, you will need to put the new coin on top of the stack, not slide it under the stack or it will collapse!
