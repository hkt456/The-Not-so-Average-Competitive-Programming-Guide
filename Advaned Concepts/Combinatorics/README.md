# Combinatorics
> Simple counting rules aren't enough to sufficiently cover many complex counting problems that you face in Combinatorics.
## Description
- It is sensible to introduce Combinatorics as once of the first advanced topics and techniques. While Combinatorics itself might only come up occassionally, the techniques and principles are universally applied in solving many counting, optimization problems.
- We also would not discuss the basics of Combinatorics such as the Binomial Coefficient, Factorials. Instead, the bulk of the discussion shall be dedicated to Inclusion-Exclusion Principle and the Star and Bar technique as well as some other niche Combinatorial tricks that is used in Mathematics.
